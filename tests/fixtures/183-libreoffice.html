	10 November 2020 at a home in Illawong. The occupant of the home
	owned three motorcycles which were parked in the garage. The two
	which were stolen were valued at $15,000 and $6000. On 8 November
	2020 the victim advertised a car and motorcycle for sale. In the
	course of people responding to theadvertisement he supplied his home
	address. Beginning in the early morning of 9 November 2020 three 
	co-offenders communicated by telephone calls and text messages,
	discussing break and enters and who would participate. Mr Lawlis’s
	name was mentioned. In the early hours of 10 November, Mr Lawlis and
	four other young men went to the home, in a car owned by one of the
	co-offenders' mothers. The garage door was damaged, locks securing
	the motorcycles were broken and the motorcycles wheeled outside. One
	of thestolen motorcycles was put in the car and the other was ridden
	away by two members of the group. </font>

	18 January 2021 at a home in West Hoxton. The occupant of the home
	owned a Volkswagen Golf motor vehicle valued at $48,000, which was
	parked in the driveway. At about 2:30AM on 18 January 2021 Mr Lawlis
	and three co-offenders arrived at the premises. The victim had gone
	to bed the previous evening with the property entry points closed
	and locked. The side gate to the property was forced open and the
	premises were entered by damaging the lock on the rear fly screen
	and glass sliding doors at the back of the house. Mr Lawlis did not
	enter the house.  The keys to the Golf and another car, a Hyundai
	Elantra, parked in the driveway, were stolen. The Hyundai, which was
	parked behind the Golf, was moved and parked nearby. The Golf was
	driven away. Later that day, at about 6:20PM, the Golf was seen
	parked near the residence of one of the co-offenders. Two men,
	wearing balaclavas and gloves, ran to and entered the car. Police
	suspected they were two of the co-offenders. </font>

	and vehicles to collect vehicles anticipated to be stolen; and there
	was some minor damage to the properties involving locks. His Honour
	found both of the offences occurred over a short period of time and

considerations of general deterrence and retribution of less
significance and elevates the significance of rehabilitation; the law
recognises the potential for cognitive, emotional and psychological
immaturity of a young person contributing to offending.”</font></font></p>

	father was in gaol for much of the time. When Mr Lawlis was aged 14
	or 15, he was sexually abused by an officer in juvenile detention.
	He became depressed and subject to flashbacks. He began to use
	cannabis and the drug ‘ice’ to block out the effects of the
	assault. He committed crimes to fund his drug addiction. Mr Lawlis
	told Dr Smith that after he was released from gaol (which was in
	September 2022) he had begun to see drug and alcohol and psychology
	counsellors, and had tried medications, but they caused him
	migraines. He and his partner had recently had a child (who was four
	months old when Dr Smith interviewed Mr Lawlis in March 2024) and he
	had been “clean” since he was released from gaol. He was

case is not one, in my view, of an offender’s exercise of free
choice in entering into drugs before becoming an addict. It was a
misguided attempt to cope with his condition and with his severely
traumatic experiences. In turn, it contributed to certain disorders
affecting and impairing the offender’s executive functioning. I
accept on the probabilities, and not looking at the matter too
finely, that there is a connection between his conditions and his
offending which serves to reduce his moral culpability and makes the
offender less than a fully appropriate vehicle for general and
specific deterrence. Acknowledging these matters, and particularly in
view of the circumstance that the offending occurred when the
offender was actually intoxicated at the time (which is not itself a
mitigating factor), on the other hand, the concern of his absence of
control does, however, bring to bear a concern of the need for
community protection. That particular factor is, however, affected by
certain aspects of his subjective case to which I return later in

acknowledged that his record was such as to also require a sentence
which accords weight to personal deterrence. I agree with this but
would also add that for offences of this kind, further significant
weight should be accorded to acknowledge the harm to the victims and
also to protect the community (notwithstanding promising signs of the
