# Your Personal Grimoire

## Enter the Grimoire

![Navigator showing your enrolled unit and activities](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-01.png)

After logging in, you see the Navigator with your enrolled units and activities. Instead of clicking Start on an activity, you will create your own workspace — your personal grimoire.

![Annotation page with Create Workspace button](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-02.png)

Navigate to the annotation page directly. The Create Workspace button lets you start a workspace outside any activity — a loose workspace that belongs only to you.

![Your new loose workspace on the annotation page](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-03.png)

Your workspace is created. Unlike activity-based workspaces, this one has no inherited tags and no course association. It is your blank slate — a grimoire waiting to be filled.

## Bring Your Conversation

Copy an AI conversation that you want to analyse. This could be from ChatGPT, Claude, or any other tool. Paste it into the editor to begin building your grimoire.

![AI conversation pasted into the editor](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-04.png)

Paste your AI conversation into the editor. This conversation about cultural markers in Japanese legal translation will be the artefact you annotate.

Your conversation is processed and displayed with formatted turns. The grimoire now holds your artefact — ready for annotation.

## Make Meaning Through Tags

Your workspace has no tags — unlike activity-based workspaces that inherit the instructor's tag vocabulary, your grimoire starts empty. You build your own analytical vocabulary: an emergent folksonomy that reflects how you see the conversation.

![Tag settings button in the toolbar](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-06.png)

Click the tag settings button (gear icon) in the toolbar.

![Tag management dialog with no existing tags](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-07.png)

The dialog is empty — you are starting from scratch. Click Add Group to create your first tag group.

![Tag group 'My Analysis' with three student-created tags](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-08.png)

Create a tag group and tags that make sense for your analysis. These tags — 'AI Assumption', 'Cultural Gap', and 'Useful Insight' — reflect the student's own analytical categories, not the instructor's.

![Done button to close tag management](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-09.png)

Click Done to save your tags and return to the annotation page.

## Annotate Your Conversation

With your tags ready, read through the conversation and annotate the parts that matter. Each highlight is a claim about the text — a moment where you assert that this passage is significant and why.

![Tag toolbar with your custom tags](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-10.png)

Select text in the conversation, then click a tag to apply it.

![Text highlighted and tagged with your own category](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-11.png)

Your tags — not the instructor's — categorise the annotation. The highlight appears in the sidebar.

![Comment input on the annotation card](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-12.png)

Type your comment, then click the post button.

![Comment reflecting on the AI's cultural assumption](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-13.png)

Add a comment explaining your annotation. This is where reflection happens — you are not just marking text, you are articulating why it matters.

## Organise Your Highlights

![Organise tab button](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-14.png)

Click the Organise tab to see your highlights grouped by tag.

### Viewing Your Tags

![Organise tab showing highlights grouped by your tags](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-15.png)

The Organise tab displays your highlights in columns, one column per tag. Your emergent vocabulary becomes a lens for seeing patterns across the conversation.

### Reordering Within a Column

Drag highlights up and down within a column to group related passages together. This lets you build clusters of evidence before writing your response.

### Moving Between Columns

Drag a highlight from one column to another to reclassify it under a different tag. As your analysis develops, you may find that a passage fits a different category than you first thought.

*Note: with longer conversations, you may need to scroll within each column to see all your highlights.*

## Write Your Response

![Respond tab button](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-16.png)

Click the Respond tab to write your analysis.

### Writing Your Response

![Respond tab with reference panel and markdown editor](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-17.png)

The Respond tab gives you a markdown editor alongside your highlights. Use it to draft a reflection that draws on the patterns you identified.

![Drafting a response with markdown formatting](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-18.png)

The editor supports markdown formatting: `#` for headings, `**bold**` for emphasis, and `*` for bullet lists. Your formatting renders as you type.

For a full guide to markdown syntax, see [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Locating Source Text

![Locate button on a reference card](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-19.png)

Click the target icon on any reference card to jump back to its highlight in the Annotate tab.

![Navigated back to the highlighted passage from Respond tab](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-20.png)

This lets you move between analysis and source text — check the original context while writing your response.

## Connect to Your Unit

Your grimoire has grown from a blank slate into a structured analysis. Now you can connect it to your unit — associating your personal work with the course activity so your instructor can see it alongside the class work.

![Placement dialog for associating workspace with a unit](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-21.png)

Click the placement chip in the header to open the placement dialog. Your enrolled units appear in the cascading selects because you are already enrolled.

![Cascading selects with UNIT1234, week, and activity selected](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-22.png)

Select your unit, week, and activity from the cascading dropdowns. Your enrolment in UNIT1234 makes it available in the placement dialog.

![Workspace now associated with the course activity](screenshots/your-personal-grimoire-23.png)

Your personal grimoire is now connected to the course activity. It appears alongside other students' work in the unit, while retaining your personal tag vocabulary and annotations.
